## Used tools

* Everything was developed using R, RStudio and Shiny

* rCharts was used to create the charts

* The 1st chart is using Morris library

* The 2nd and 3rd chart are using HighCharts

* The 2dn and 3rd chart should to be one, but I could not change the tooltip in time to include the countries name. rCharts can be tricky sometimes. :)

## Encoding Note

* An encoding problem was found at shinyapp deploy

* The app was working right localy, but encoding problems prevent it from working when deployed to server

* The "solution" was to remove non-ascii chars using iconv, like the following:

```{r}
data <- c("CÃ´te d'Ivoire", "Brazil", "Argentina")
print(data)
print(iconv(data, "utf8", "ascii", "?"))
```
